# Purpose
Here I try to build and publish a dot net application with a single bash script.

# Steps

### If dot net is not installed in the remote machine, install it using this
`sudo snap install dotnet-sdk --classic --channel=6.0`

`sudo snap install dotnet-runtime-60 --classic`

`sudo snap alias dotnet-runtime-60.dotnet dotnet`
