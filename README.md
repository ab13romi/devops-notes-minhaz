# How to use
### At first clone the repo using
`git clone https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes.git`

### Then go into each folder and read what that folder does.

# Here are some folders I'm proud of.

## 1. kubernates loadbalancing with nginx

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/24.%20kubernates%20loadbalancing%20with%20nginx) I built a full simulation of loadbalancing to between different services using **kubernetes**

## 2. Kubernetes cluster using bare metal linux.

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/35.%20setup%20a%20kubernetes%20cluster) I setup a full Kubernetes master-worker cluster using bare metal linux.

## 3. Leader election using **Zookeeper**

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/37.%20zookeeper%20leader%20election%20in%20a%20distributed%20system) I simulate a solution for leader election problem using a distributed queue.
