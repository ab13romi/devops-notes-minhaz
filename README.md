# Purpose
### This repo is where I will document my **devops journey**. 

### This repo will contain tutorial to do many things related to devops, for now docker, kubernates, nginx etc.

<br>

#### This repo is for document purpose only, many of my ready to use scripts will be in [this](https://github.com/minhaz1217/linux-configurations) repo


# Here are some projects that I'm proud of in this repo.

## 1. Kubernates loadbalancing with nginx

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/24.%20kubernates%20loadbalancing%20with%20nginx) I built a full simulation of loadbalancing to between different services using **kubernetes**

## 2. Kubernetes cluster using bare metal linux.

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/35.%20setup%20a%20kubernetes%20cluster) I setup a full Kubernetes master-worker cluster using bare metal linux.

## 3. Leader election using **Zookeeper**

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/37.%20zookeeper%20leader%20election%20in%20a%20distributed%20system) I simulate a solution for leader election problem using a distributed queue.

## 4. Continuous deployment using a single bash script

### [Here](https://github.com/minhaz1217/devops-notes/tree/master/39.%20CD%20with%20a%20single%20bash%20script) I wrote a script that will `change git branch` > `build an application` > `connect to a remote host` > `upload the built application` > `restart the application` with only one execution. I regularly use this script to automate the deployment procedure of the different projects I'm in charge of at my organization.
