# Purpose
To setup [pingme](https://github.com/kha7iq/pingme) with discord so that I can send notification message to a channel after a long command finished running.


# Steps

### At first go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and login. 
If you don't already have a discord account, create one.
